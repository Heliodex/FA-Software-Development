The club is a Local shinty club competing in both national and local competition, the club has itâ€™s own pitch, clubhouse and related facilities.

We are looking for a website that has

- Squad and match-day team information including biographies and captaincy
- Want to show fixtures and results separately to fundraising and social events
- Match-day write-ups/reports with image galleries
- Revenue sources:
	- Match-day vendor registration/fee information
	- Fundraising
	- Donations
	- Sponsorships
		- Advertising opportunities (e.g. signage and match-day programmes)
		- Weekly lotto (where to buy, winners, current total)
- Contact information
- Club affiliations
- Board of directors, AGM minutes
- Club history

We do not have any social media presence at the moment.

We also have a gym, social club as well as the pitch that we would like a booking system for.
