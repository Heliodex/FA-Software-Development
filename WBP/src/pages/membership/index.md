## Meet the Team

### 1. Calum "The Cannon" MacLeod &ndash; Forward

Fast, fierce, and known for his unstoppable drives from the halfway line, Calum is a nightmare for defenders and a dream for highlight reels. Grew up swinging a caman before he could walk.

### 2. Ewan Fraser &ndash; Midfield

The tireless engine of the team, Ewan's stamina is legendary. When he's not stealing possession, he's assisting goals and barking orders. A true midfield general.

### 3. Ruaridh Grant &ndash; Defender

Built like a stone wall with the calm of a loch at dawn. Ruaridh rarely speaks, but when he does, everyone listens. And he never misses a block.

### 4. Jamie-Anne MacKay &ndash; Wing Forward

Lightning on two feet and fearless in the face of any challenge, Jamie-Anne weaves through defenses like they're standing still. Don't let the smile fool youâ€”she's ruthless in the D.

### 5. Isla Cameron &ndash; Keeper

The last line of defense and the first to roar a victory chant. With cat-like reflexes and nerves of steel, Isla's saves have kept more than a few clean sheets.

### 6. Finlay "Sticks" Morrison &ndash; Utility Player

He's played every position and excelled in them all. Finlay's versatility makes him invaluable. Known for his wild hair, wild plays, and even wilder celebrations.

### 7. Morven Douglas &ndash; Defender

Quiet, precise, and endlessly dependable. Morven reads the game like a novel and always seems to be in the right place at the right time.
