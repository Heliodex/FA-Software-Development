		<b>The Stag:</b> This is a short walk that takes you through the farm and surrounding area.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>The Highland Cow:</b> A longer, relaxing walk along the paths on low level around the Selkirk area, with
		picturesque scenery.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>The Beaver:</b> A walk along the Kirkstead Burn, passing by the nearby forested areas and St Mary's Loch.
		Perfect for skimming stones!
	</li>
	<li>

		squirrel-spotting opportunities along the way.
	</li>
	<li>
